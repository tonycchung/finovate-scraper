It arrives at the  very best set of loan terms – balancing the needs of customers, shareholders,  lenders, dealers, regulators, and all other stakeholders. We use  state-of-the-art behavioral models, married with advanced financial analytics  and cash-flow analyses, as inputs into a decision engine capable of finding the  best solution of 1.2e<span class=""super"">19</span> possibilities, instantly.                    <p><strong>How they describe their product/innovation:</strong> Verde  Aurora™ sets itself apart from the limited decision-making capability of  today’s loan origination systems. You need more than a collection of filters  and screens to guide a manual decision. Verde Aurora™ uses advanced behavioral  models and projected cash flows to automate offers with rare staff involvement.  Each loan is designed to maximize the opportunity for both shareholders and  customers. This solution is equally effective across the full credit spectrum  and is scalable for lenders of all sizes. In subprime space, it routinely  increases approval rates fourfold, and in superprime, it more than doubles  average ROA’s.</p>",http://www.finovate.com/spring14vid/verde.html,http://www.finovate.com/spring14vid/logos/VerdeInternational.jpg

Creditworthiness of a user is determined  in less than a minute on the basis of up to 10,000 data points and loans are  paid out automatically within minutes to a customer’s bank account, credit card  or e-wallet.                    <p><strong>How they describe their product/innovation:</strong> The self-learning proprietary algorithm scores an applicant’s  creditworthiness within less than a minute.

Compared  to traditional rating organizations like Schufa or FICO, the Kreditech Algorithm  only studies the financial situation of the customer in the moment of the  application and does not use historical data. The technology is therefore  flexible and can quickly enter and adapt to new markets. There are 5 billion people  in the world that have no access to financial products, and our technology is  able to provide that to them.</p>",http://www.finovate.com/spring14vid/kreditech.html,http://www.finovate.com/spring14vid/logos/Kreditech.jpg

Assembling such charts into a pitchbook is  a simple drag-and-drop exercise.

Our credit  card vault allows businesses to securely tokenize and store credit card  information in the Cloud for single and repeat transactions across any of our 50+  supported payment gateways. Launched in March 2013, we’re a seven-person  angel-funded startup in Durham, NC. Our more than 150 customers include SaaS  commerce platforms, billing and booking solutions, fintech payment services,  and mobile and marketplace offerings.                    <p><strong>How  they describe their product/innovation:</strong> Prior to today, Spreedly could  take a stored card and pass it against a Spreedly integrated payment gateway.  With today’s announcement three new things are happening. Firstly, customer’s  can create their own end points to which they want to pass cards. No more  relying on Spreedly to do the work. Secondly, those end points can be more than  just payment gateways. Think of it as an industry API for consuming card data  (hotel, ticketing, restaurant, and transportation). And thirdly, customers can  use Spreedly to automatically update cards across 60+ gateways, which means no  more lost revenue from lost or expired cards.</p>",http://www.finovate.com/spring14vid/spreedly.html,http://www.finovate.com/spring14vid/logos/Spreedly.jpg

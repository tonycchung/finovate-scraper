Blooom  displays how their 401k should be allocated and gives the user some latitude to  adjust the recommended allocation. In a few more steps, the user can then hire  blooom to make these changes and, more importantly, rebalance and adjust the  allocation for the user going forward. It is a new and intelligent way to get  help with your 401k . . . all for just $10 per month.</p>",http://www.finovate.com/fall14vid/blooom.html,http://www.finovate.com/fall14vid/logos/blooom.jpg,

Sr. Pago enables individuals and  small businesses to have access to banking related services without having to  formally enter the regulated banking system in Mexico. While it is available to  consumers and small businesses in Mexico with traditional bank accounts, it  sees the greatest opportunity for impacting the ""unbanked"" population  in Mexico.

It seeks to provide a secure ecosystem for a population that has been subjected  to the high fees associated with check cashing, the inconveniences of using  convenience stores to perform basic banking functions, and the security risks  of carrying cash for everyday transactions.</p>",http://www.finovate.com/fall14vid/senorpago.html,http://www.finovate.com/fall14vid/logos/Sr.jpg,

The concept dates back  to 2005, and the original idea was to generate automatic research notes  (REPORTS) on any company listed on the stock market, worldwide, without human  intervention. Far from being a simple summary of boring raw financial data,  this REPORT had to interpret the figures in a clear language. The REPORT had to  reach the same degree of professionalism than one being written by a financial  analyst. SCREENER/REPORT is an automatic tool that brings an immediate and  crystal clear diagnosis on a trading opportunity.                    <p><strong>How they describe their product/innovation:</strong></p>                    <ol><li>SCREENER<br>                        Open the trading ideas box.
